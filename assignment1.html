						<h3>Mona Lisa</h3>
					</div>
					<p>The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance,[4][5] it has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world".The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.The painting has been definitively identified to depict Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini,the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.

						<h3>The Last Supper</h3>
					</div>
					<p>The Last Supper is a mural painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, dated to c.1495–1498. The painting represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with the Twelve Apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of John – specifically the moment after Jesus announces that one of his apostles will betray him.Its handling of space, mastery of perspective, treatment of motion and complex display of human emotion has made it one of the Western world's most recognizable paintings and among Leonardo's most celebrated works. Some commentators consider it pivotal in inaugurating the transition into what is now termed the High Renaissance
